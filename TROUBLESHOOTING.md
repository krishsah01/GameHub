# 🚨 GitHub Pages Deployment Error Fix

## Error Message You're Seeing:
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
Error: Create Pages site failed
```

## ✅ Quick Fix (Step by Step):

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings
1. **Go to your GitHub repository** (in web browser)
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (top of repository page)
3. **Scroll down and click "Pages"** (in left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"** → Select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Repository is Public
- If your repository is private, you need GitHub Pro to use Pages
- Or make your repository public: Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility

### Step 3: Check Repository Permissions
- Make sure you have admin access to the repository
- If it's an organization repo, check organization settings

### Step 4: Re-run the Workflow
1. Go to **Actions tab** in your repository
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Click **"Re-run all jobs"**

## 🔄 Alternative Solution:

If the main workflow still fails, use the simplified deployment:

```bash
# In your project directory:
cd /Users/krishkumarsah/Documents/Projects/GameHub
mv .github/workflows/deploy.yml .github/workflows/deploy-old.yml
mv .github/workflows/deploy-simple.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to simplified deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 What Each Error Means:

- **"Resource not accessible by integration"** = GitHub Pages not enabled
- **"Create Pages site failed"** = Missing permissions or Pages disabled
- **"Not Found"** = Repository or Pages endpoint not accessible

## ✅ Success Indicators:

You'll know it worked when you see:
- ✅ Green checkmark in Actions tab
- 🌐 Your site live at: `https://[username].github.io/GameHub/`
- 📧 Possibly a notification email from GitHub

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. Check if your repository name is exactly "GameHub"
2. Ensure you're pushing to the "main" branch (not "master")
3. Try the alternative workflow above
4. Check GitHub Status page for any ongoing issues
